# A Render.com blueprint for Wordpress version 6.2 with PHP 8

This is a template repository for running [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) on Render. Forked from [render-examples/wordpress](https://github.com/render-examples/wordpress), it has been updated to work with recent Wordpress and PHP versions.

* It uses Wordpress version 6.2 and PHP 8.

* Adds PORT environment variable that's missing from the official repo.

* It uses the [official Wordpress Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/).

* [Render Disks](https://render.com/docs/disks) provide fast, persistent SSD storage for content storage.

* It uses [MySQL on Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-mysql) for the database.
